# Muyao Niu's weekly AI journel - Week1(9.15 ~ 9.28)

My journel might be kinda boring, for the sack that I have already found my pace of AI usage, so there might be some repeating.

#### Vibe Coding
Doing vibe coding for my personal project and colleboration project. (Same, always)

#### Math Assistant
Help me to figure out the definition of unfamiliar math field, also provides and correct the training questions for me. (Exactly the same, and even more)

#### Python review
When I was doing my INST326 exersice, I will do the question in required way, and do it in my own way. But sometimes, AI might find a better expression or cleaner logic about problem solving. (I am appreciate)

#### Art refine
Still story about ARTT255, I tried to send my draft to Gemini, and used nano banana to generate an AI refined work, and submitted to discussion session of the course.

#### Game designning
I made a deep and long conversation about my video-game idea of the designning, story arranging, and stratagy planning. It turned out to be Gemini has a really nice sense of stroy telling and game dev (I know professor had a bad impression about it, so did I, but I have to say Gemini is a master about story telling, better then most of any models else). Gemini will tell me how could the stucked story continue, even brought me a impressive design that attracted me a lot. Now I intend to realize this new project this winter vacation.
