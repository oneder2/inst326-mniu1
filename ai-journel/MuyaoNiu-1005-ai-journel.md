# Muyao Niu's weekly AI journel - Week1(9.29 ~ 10.5)

My journel might be kinda boring, for the sack that I have already found my pace of AI usage, so there might be some repeating.

#### Vibe Coding
Doing vibe coding for my personal project and colleboration project. (Same, always)

#### Math Assistant
Help me to figure out the definition of unfamiliar math field, also provides and correct the training questions for me. What's different is that I used it to prepare my math exam. I will feed it out textbook and class note, and require it give me an exam to test. Over and over again, until the score is satisfying.

#### Python review
When I was doing my INST326 exersice, I will do the question in required way, and do it in my own way. But sometimes, AI might find a better expression or cleaner logic about problem solving. (I am appreciate)

#### Personal site building
I built the personal site with the help of Gemini. It shared me the wisdom about server, proxy by nginx, DNS config on cloudflare, and so on. Finally I got my own personal website, and earned a lot of knowledge about deployment as well as server interaction.

#### Team work structure arranger
About out INST326 term project, I and my groupmates asked Gemini what to do next, what will we do, and it turns out to be it is a good structure arranger. According to the language we sent it, Gemini could generate nice frame work of the document, which is benificial to out dev also AI prompting. Although our project is still a huge work, I am more confident then ever that we will make it on time.
