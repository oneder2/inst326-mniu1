# Muyao Niu's weekly AI journel - Week1(9.8 ~ 9.14)

My journel might be kinda boring, for the sack that I have already found my pace of AI usage, so there might be some repeating.

#### Vibe Coding
Doing vibe coding for my personal project and colleboration project. (Same)

#### Math Assistant
Help me to figure out the definition of unfamiliar math field, also provides and correct the training questions for me. (Exactly the same)

#### Python review
When I was doing my INST326 exersice, I will do the question in required way, and do it in my own way. But sometimes, AI might find a better expression or cleaner logic about problem solving. (I am appreciate)

#### Picture fixxing (just for fun)
I took a single color picture at a corner of UMD, and require AI to fill some color on it, or chenge the perspective. It did pretty good!

#### Art refine
Currently, I am having class at ARTT255 about digital art. Sometimes I cannot sure if I did a satisfying work in my project or what else can I improve, so I just sent them to Gemini and required a feedback. It performs well that pointed out my several blind points, which is helpful and enough for me to walk furthermore

#### GitHub repository exploring
I asked Claude about if it could provides be methods about how to patch a mod on a game called Diablo II, because I kept targeting and hunting resourses but found nothing. I was impressed it did pretty well and fast, that it stated the condition of mine honorably, and gave me a practical solution about my next step. I did, and it works pretty good! Never before I have ever expect it performs good in this tiny aspect.
