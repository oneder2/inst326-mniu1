# Muyao Niu's weekly AI journel - Week1(10.6 ~ 10.12)

My journel might be kinda boring, for the sack that I have already found my pace of AI usage, so there might be some repeating.

#### Vibe Coding
Doing vibe coding for my personal project and colleboration project. (Same, always)

#### Math Assistant
Help me to figure out the definition of unfamiliar math field, also provides and correct the training questions for me. What's different is that I used it to prepare my math exam. I will feed it out textbook and class note, and require it give me an exam to test. Over and over again, until the score is satisfying.
I did it again for several times, fot the sack that I was to devoted to developing, that my attendence of major courses was bad. So I reviewed a lot before the exam. The concequence... Well, acceptable, but I will definatly be worse if it is not AI helped me on it.

#### Python review
When I was doing my INST326 exersice, I will do the question in required way, and do it in my own way. But sometimes, AI might find a better expression or cleaner logic about problem solving. (I am appreciate)

#### Set up
I am planning to carry out a plan about "earn 1000$ each month with an APP" with the help of AI. The basic idea is build and deploy my SaaS product online, and let n8n do the marketing and advertisement. I do not really expect it have to success, but just curious how far can I go within this approach.
