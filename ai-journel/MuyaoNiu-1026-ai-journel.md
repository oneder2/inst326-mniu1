# Muyao Niu's weekly AI journel - Week1(10.13 ~ 10.26)

My journel might be kinda boring, for the sack that I have already found my pace of AI usage, so there might be some repeating.

#### Vibe Coding
Doing vibe coding for my personal project and colleboration project. (Same, always)

#### Math Assistant
Help me to figure out the definition of unfamiliar math field, also provides and correct the training questions for me.

#### Python review
When I was doing my INST326 exersice, I will do the question in required way, and do it in my own way. But sometimes, AI might find a better expression or cleaner logic about problem solving. (I am appreciate)

#### Rust expadition
I used AI to help me gain knowledge about Rust programming. It start with an idea about build a project about text editing, and it turned out to be hard but still practical. Now I let AI do coding, and I will the the researching about what kind of issue I am encountering about, providing the vibe coding agent idea or code from GitHub with proper lisence

#### Buisness finalize
One of my friend set up a buisness, and I took response about the techinal part. After around 3 month developing, the production has almost been finished, and about to open to the public. I felt a great relief.
