# Muyao Niu's weekly AI journel - Week1(10.27 ~ 11.2)

My journel might be kinda boring, for the sack that I have already found my pace of AI usage, so there might be some repeating.

#### Vibe Coding
Doing vibe coding for my personal project and colleboration project. (Same, always)

#### Math Assistant
Help me to figure out the definition of unfamiliar math field, also provides and correct the training questions for me.

#### Python review
When I was doing my INST326 exersice, I will do the question in required way, and do it in my own way. But sometimes, AI might find a better expression or cleaner logic about problem solving. (I am appreciate)

#### Rust expadition: a text editor
Before this project, I have never imagine how a text editor really works. But within these days coding with ai, I believe I learnt something about this. It contains: text update(Create, Update, Revise, Delete), state rercording to privide a support for ctrl+z/y, temp file recorded in certain directory, save and load. It is a complete but reasonable process. When I figured out the save/loading principle myself, the great feeling of joy filled my heart.

#### Buisness finalize: recent update
One of my friend set up a buisness, and I took response about the techinal part. After around 3 month developing, the production has almost been finished, and about to open to the public. I felt a great relief.

update: 11.2: Beta test start (FIRE) barely sleep, barely regular schedule

#### Personal website
I set a personal server, deployed n8n and resume via this server's nginx. But I have not made my personal website, so I would like to do it, and make some funny site.
